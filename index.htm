      <h2>About the Spinner</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Wheel Of List – your interactive tool for random name selection! This spinner was designed to be simple, fun, and effective for classroom activities, raffles, or any event where you need to choose a random winner.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Use the Spinner:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enter Your Names:</strong> On the right-hand side, you'll find a text area where you can enter names, one per line. Once you've added all the names, click the <em>Update Wheel</em> button to load them into the spinner.</li>
        <li><strong>Spin the Wheel:</strong> With the names loaded, simply click anywhere on the spinner. Watch as the wheel spins with exciting sound effects and dynamic animations.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Selection:</strong> As the wheel slows down, a pointer at the bottom of the spinner will indicate the winning segment. Once the wheel stops, the name aligned with the pointer will be selected as the winner.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoreboard:</strong> Each time a name is selected, it appears on the scoreboard on the right. In cases where multiple names are present, the winning name is removed from the wheel, and the process can be repeated until all names are selected.</li>
